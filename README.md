BodyShapePredictionSandbox
==========================

Sandbox for morphing 3D body models, taking measurements and comparing results. This was used as part of my thesis where based on a limited number of input measurements an accurate prediction of the rest of the body could be made.

The website makes use of node.js, backbone.js and D3.js. 

The 3D models used are in .obj format. Unfortuatly .obj files couldn't be included in the repository due to licensing issues. 

A live version of the sand box can be seen at http://54.247.101.245/
